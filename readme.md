## **Tabby's EasyMap is a lightweight, opensource C++ GIS development platform**

#### I wrote EasyMap for my Master degree project originally. After graduation(Master), I continued to maintain it and added many new features in couple years. EasyMap is designed by OOD concepts. It consists of more than 30 replaceable components. The architecture is highly expendable. Several GIS related projects were developed by me and my friends using EasyMap as the underlying library.

#### core library: /easylib
